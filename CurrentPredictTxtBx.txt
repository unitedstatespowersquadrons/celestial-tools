CURRENT Predict Form for Marine Navigation (MN) and Advanced Marine Navigation (AMN) classes:

a. Purpose:  Determine the set and drift (velocity) of the tidal current at a desired time, using data
extracted from a Tidal Current Table, as taught in the USPS Advanced Marine Navigation (AMN) course.  
The Current tool uses a form similar to the worksheet taughts in the MN/AMN classes.

b. Operation:  
Required Input fields:
1. Location Name of reference station
2. Station ID number for reference station
3. Date and Time for desired current speed and direction
4. Using current references tables for location, input the 3 sets of date/time from slack current and the 
2 sets of date/time, Flood/Ebb designation, speed in knots, and direction in True Degrees.
5. Use the 'Calculation' button at the middle bottom of the form to request the calculated height of tide
at the desired date and time and location.

Note:  Tidal current tables use standard time.  The user must convert daylight savings times to standard
times before extracting data from the Tidal Current Table.

The program will recognize when the selected times of slack and maximum  cross midnight.

When updating any input field, yopu will need to activate the "Calculate" button to get updated results.

Choices that would be circled on a paper worksheet will appear in bold type.

Activating the "Clear" button clears all inputs and outputs.

Localized velocities are rounded to hundredths of a knot, except for the "50-90 Rule" where they are
rounded to tenths of a knot.  The predicted velocity is rounded to tenths of a knot.

Celestial Tools uses the method of the PREDICTION OF CURRENT AND DIRECTION form for the "50-90 Rule". 
Note that if the Time Difference converted to minutes (line (4) of the form) is
not evenly divisible by three, then Time#3 on line (6) will differ from the later of the bracketed times
(line (1)) by one minute.
