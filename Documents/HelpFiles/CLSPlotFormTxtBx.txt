CLS Plot form

Purpose: To plot on a Constant Latitude Scale (CLS) USPS form a reduced sight or a series of sights comprising a fix. 
This plotting form can be accessed from the SightLog form, from the Law of Cosines Sight Reduction (SRF) form, from
the Alternative Sight Reduction Methods form, and from the Fix form. The approprise button to use this plotting form
appears on each form listed when it can be used. You can use the CLS form repeatedly by a series of sights and fixes
and each will plot on the same form as long as you do not exit the CLS Plot form. On the form there are three buttons
you can use:
	1. Print Sights  - Print a text file report of the Sights and Fixes that are inputs to these form plotted
	2. Print Screen - Print the visible screen of the CLS Plot form
	3. Exit - Close this form and return to the previous input form
	
The CLS Plot form seeks to implement the same CLS Plotting form (CLS-98) that is used in USPS classes.
