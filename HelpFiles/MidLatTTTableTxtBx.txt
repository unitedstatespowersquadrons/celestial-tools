This form can be invoked from the Main Menu or from the Sailings Form when Mid-Lat destination info is requested.
When invoked from Main Menu, the location info, course, and distance will be blank and Traverse Table check box is selected
(box is unchecked).
When invoked from Sailings Form, the Sailings Form location, course, and distance info is pushed into the same fields

and taught in ABC Navigation - N - class).
