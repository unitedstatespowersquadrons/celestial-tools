TIDE Predict Form for Marine Navigation (MN) and Advanced Marine Navigation (AMN) classes:

a. Purpose:  Determine the height of the tide at a desired time, using data extracted from a Tide Table,
as taught in the USPS Advanced Marine Navigation (AMN) course . The height of tides at the desired data 
and time, and location will be calculated using the 'Rule of 12ths' methods taught in class.  

b. Operation:  
Required Input Fields:
1. Location Name of reference station
2. Station ID number for reference station
3. Date and Time for desired tide height
4. Using tide references tables for location, input the 4 sets of date/time of tide, High/Low designation,
and tide height in feet.
5. Use the 'Calculation' button at the middle bottom of the form to request the calculated height of tide
at the desired date and time and location.

Note:  Tide tables use standard time.  The user must convert daylight savings times to standard times
before extracting data from the Tide Table.

Changing any of the required data fields listed above will require the 'Calculation' button to be clicked
again to produce updated results.

Activating the "Clear" button clears all inputs and outputs.

All height results are rounded to the nearest tenth of a unit.
