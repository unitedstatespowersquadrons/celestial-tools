60D=ST

a. Purpose:  Calculate speed, time, or distance, given two of the three quantities.  This tool is similar
to Bowditch 2002 Table 11 (Speed, time, and Distance), with the exceptions noted below.

b. Operation:  Enter the values for the at least two of the quantities.  Press the button for the
quantity to be calculated.  If there is already a value present it will be updated based on the other two
values.  If the unknown value is time, it will be displayed as minutes and days/hours/minutes.

Inputs and outputs have upper limits, perhaps unreasonable high, that allow for a long ocean voyage:
99.9 knots, 59999 minutes or 99 days 999 hours 59 minutes, 9999.9 nautical miles.  If a calculated output
value exceeds its limit the value is replaced by dashes and a message is displayed.

Time can be entered as whole minutes or whole days/whole hours/whole minutes.   (If the desired time is
of another format, e.g. 125.6 hours, use the Time Addition/Subtraction/Conversion tool in Navig. Math to
convert to days/hours/minutes.)  Once a value is entered in any of the four time boxes the inappropriate
ones are disabled.

Pressing the Clear button clears all values.

c. Accuracy/Resolution:  Outputs are rounded:  speed to tenths of a knot, time to whole minutes, and
distance to tenths of a nautical mile.  Note that Bowditch 2002 Table 11 does not use the USPS standard
for rounding.  For instance, with a speed of 4.5 knots and a time of 30 minutes, a distance of 2.25
nautical miles is calculated, which is rounded to 2.2 nm by Table 11, but 2.3 nm by Celestial Tools.
