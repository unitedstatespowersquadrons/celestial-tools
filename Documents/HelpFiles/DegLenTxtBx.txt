LENGTH OF DEGREE

a. Purpose:  Calculates the length of a degree of latitude and longitude in various linear units for both
a spherical Earth (where 1° of latitude, or 1° along any great circle, is defined as 60 nautical miles)
and the WGS84 spheroid (the most commonly used default datum for GPS units), for a specified latitude,
north or south.  The WGS84 Spheroid output duplicates Bowditch 2002 Table 7.

b. Operation:  Enter the latitude of interest.  Press the "Calculate" button.  The lengths will be
displayed in feet, meters, statute miles, and nautical miles, to two decimal places (although for feet
and meters the accuracy probably does not warrant that resolution), and will be automatically updated for
whatever data is currently entered.  The length of a degree of latitude is calculated for a degree
spanning 1/2° north to 1/2° south of the specified latitude.

c. Accuracy/Resolution:   Lengths are displayed to three decimal places for nautical miles and statute
miles, and to whole feet and meters, to duplicate Bowditch 2002 Table 7.
