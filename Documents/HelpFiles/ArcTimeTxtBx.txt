ARCS AND TIMES CONVERTERS

a. Purpose:  Convert expressions in arc to their equivalents in time and expressions in time to their
equivalents in arc.  Convert Local Mean Time (LMT) to Zone Time (ZT) and ZT to LMT.

b. Operation:  Select the desired conversions.  Enter the values to be converted.  For LMT and ZT
conversions also enter the longitude.  Press the "Convert" button and the equivalent/converted values are
displayed.  For LMT and ZD conversions, the Zone Meridian (ZM) is also displayed.

If all inputs for a conversion are left blank, that conversion is not displayed.  The inputs are not
treated as zeros.

Switching conversion from LMT to ZT to ZT to LMT rf vice versa retains the input data.

Arc input is limited to 359°59.9'.  Time input is limited to 23h59m59s.

c. Accuracy/Resolution:  Arc output is rounded to the nearest 0.1'.  Time outputs are rounded to the
nearest second.
