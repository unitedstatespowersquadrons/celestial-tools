Custom Plot form

Purpose: To plot on a standard square plotting form a reduced sight or a series of sights comprising a fix. 
This plotting form can be accessed from the SightLog form, from the Law of Cosines Sight Reduction (SRF) form, from
the Alternative Sight Reduction Methods form, and from the Fix form. The approprise button to use this plotting form
appears on each form listed when it can be used. You can use the CLS form repeatedly by a series of sights and fixes
and each will plot on the same form as long as you do not exit the CLS Plot form. On the form there are five inputs
you can use:
	1. Print Sights  - Print a text file report of the Sights and Fixes that are inputs to these form plotted
	2. Print Screen - Print the visible screen of the CLS Plot form
	3. Exit - Close this form and return to the previous input form
	4. Change scale of plot form: 5 options
		4.a Default is 60 nm miles on a plot side, which is the default for the CLS Plot form
		4.b Choose 40 nm miles on a plot side for zooming in 
		4.c Choose 20 nm miles on a plot side for the largest plot zoom
		4.d Choose 80 nm miles on a plot side to zoom out 
		4.e Choose 100 nm miles on a plot side for the smallest scale zoom
	5. Check box to toggle the compass rose on or off on the plot

When options 4 or 5 are used, the Custom Plot form will redisplay with the changes requested. 
	
The Custom Plot form seeks to implement the standard square plot form that allows zooming in or out for clarity.
